This is a plugin for the springrts SPADS battle lobby bot.

It allows you to redirect a list of users to a new lobby host. It is helpful if you run several hosts and would
like to perform load balancing or simply would like to split a big group of people up simultaneously.

The syntax is:
!migrate name1 [name2 [name3 ...]]

Any number of users can be migrated at once. You can only migrate users that are currently in the battle lobby
hosted by the SPADS bot receiving the migrate command.

If you like this plugin or would like features added, just ask. Pull requests are also welcome within reason.
